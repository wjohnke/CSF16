			Block Element Characteristics: 
				* ALWAYS start on (and end with) a new line 
                * Take up the full width available
                    * Their width is 100% of their parent container
                    * They stretch out to the left and right as far as possible

            The <div>,<h1> - <h6>, <p>, and <form> elements are a block elements.

		<h2>My second header</h2> 
		
		<p>Hello World!</p>
		<p>Paragraph #2</p> 
		
		<p>Third Paragraph -> this is a lot of text that we are trying to split on two separate lines, we are going to <br> 
		see if I simply add a new line or press enter, if that will separate this string on two lines in the browser. <br>
		The answer is no, you need a break to put text on two separate lines</p>

        <!-- Note: 
        If we put inline element inside a block element, then it will start on new line and end with new line. 
        	The div (block element) will take up the entire width but the span (inline element) will only take 
        	up the width that is needed. And the reason it starts/ends with new line is because of the outside
        	block element.

        <!-- Note: 
            Inline Element Characteristics: 
				* Does NOT start on a new line
                    * They are displayed one next to another
                * Only takes up as much width as necessary
                    * Their width is based on their content

            The <span>, <a>, <img> elements are inline elements.

        <span>Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for 
        the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range
         from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex 
         web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. 
         A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, 
         may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, 
         client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, 
         and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers 
         to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. 
         Most recently Web development has come to mean the creation of content management 
         systems or CMS. These CMS can be made from scratch, proprietary or open source. 
         In broad terms the CMS acts as middleware between the database and the user through 
         the browser. A principle benefit of a CMS is that it allows non-technical people 
         to make changes to their web site without having technical knowledge.</span>
