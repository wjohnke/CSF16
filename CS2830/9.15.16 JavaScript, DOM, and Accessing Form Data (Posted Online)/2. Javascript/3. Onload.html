			// We can define a function like below. This is called a function declaration:
			function pageLoaded() {
				var box = document.getElementById("animateMe");
				box.style.backgroundColor = "green";
			}
		
		
			// Or functions can be treated like variables. This is called a function expression:
			var pageLoaded = function(x) {
				var box = document.getElementById("animateMe");
				box.style.backgroundColor = x;
			};
		
			/* After a function expression has been stored in a variable, the variable can be used as a function. */
		
			// The function above ends with a semicolon because it is a part of an executable statement. 
		
		
		
		
			// Both functions are the same. Also, note that a function without a name (like the one assigned to 'pageLoaded' in the function expression above) is called an anonymous function. 
		
			//Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name. 
	
			// In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens. That means you can store them in variables, pass them into other functions as arguments, organize them into arrays, store them in objects, etc.
			// Here I pass 'pageLoaded' to a new var called 'pageReallyDidLoad'
			var pageReallyDidLoad = pageLoaded;
